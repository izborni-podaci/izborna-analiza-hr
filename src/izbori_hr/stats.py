"""Statistics for a whole round and for each municipality: weak signals, shown with their limits and never as station
flags. Computed for each contest's two contestants with the most votes, whoever they are, or for every contestant.

Only regular stations count (at home, in constituencies I–X, or the president's stations at home): abroad and at
special stations the register is the voters who came, and the minorities' voters may vote anywhere. The tests are
those of the Serbian archive (izborna-analiza)."""
